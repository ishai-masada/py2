    - Reset the indices of the data using the Pandas method reset_index()

    - Initialize an empty DataFrame as a placeholder for the desired cars

    - Initialize a count variable

    - Iterate over the data to get the first five rows of the data from the
      Google Spreadsheet

        - Append the row to the new DataFrame

        - Set the new DataFrame equal to the result of the appended
          DataFrame

        - Increment the count variable

        - Check if the count variable is less than 4
            - Break the loop

    - Display the information of the five cars aranged by price

    - Sort the data by Horsepower in ascending order using the Pandas method
      sort_values()

    - Reset the indices of the data using the Pandas method reset_index()

    - Display the information of the five cars aranged by Horsepower

Scenario 4 (Define as an independent function)
    - Read the data from the Google Spreadsheet into a Pandas DataFrame using
      the Pandas method read_csv()

    - Set the index to be the ID column of the data using the Pandas method
      set_index()

    - Create a DataFrame with the people from the Economy Class using the
      Pandas method where()

    - Display the DataFrame with the people in the Economy Class

Scenario 5 (Define as an independent function)
    - Read the data from the Google Spreadsheet into a Pandas DataFrame using
      the Pandas method read_csv()

    - Set the index to be the ID column of the data using the Pandas method
      set_index()

    - Initialize two lists to store the ages of the males and females (One
      for each)
