- Replace the necessart parts of both URLs

Scenario 1 (Define as an independent function)
    - Initialize three placeholder variables for the name, make, and cost of the desired car

    - Read the data from the Google Spreadsheet into a Pandas DataFrame

    - Set the index to be the ID column of the data

    - Sort the data by price in ascending order

    - Iterate over the rows of the data

        - Set the Cost variable to the car's Cost

        - Set the Name variable to the car's Name

        - Set the Make variable to the car's Make

    - Display the data of the most expensive car

Scenario 2 (Define as an independent function)
    - Read the data from the Google Spreadsheet into a Pandas DataFrame

    - Set the index to be the ID column of the data

    - Initialize an empty DataFrame as a placeholder for the desired cars

    - Establish the make of the desired cars

    - Iterate over the rows of the data

        - Check of the make of the car is equal to the desired make

            - Set the DataFrame equal to the appended value

    - Reset the indices of the data

Scenario 3 (Define as an independent function)
    - Read the data from the Google Spreadsheet into a Pandas DataFrame

    - Set the index to be the ID column of the data

    - Sort the data by price in ascending order

    - Reset the indices of the data

    - Initialize an empty DataFrame as a placeholder for the desired cars

    - Initialize a count variable

    - Iterate over the data to get the first five rows of the DataFrame

        - Set the DataFrame equal to the appended value

        - Increment the count variable

        - Check if the count variable is less than 4

    - Display the information of the five cars aranged by price

    - Sort the data by Horsepower in ascending order

    - Reset the indices of the data

    - Display the information of the five cars aranged by Horsepower

Scenario 4 (Define as an independent function)
    - Read the data from the Google Spreadsheet into a Pandas DataFrame

    - Set the index to be the ID column of the data

    - Create a DataFrame with the people from the Economy Class

Scenario 5 (Define as an independent function)
    - Read the data from the Google Spreadsheet into a Pandas DataFrame

    - Set the index to be the ID column of the data

    - Initialize lists to store the ages of the males and females

    - Iterate over the rows of the data

        - Check if the column is for Males

            - Add the age to the male ages list

        - Check if the column is for Females

            - Add the age to the female ages list

    - Create the subplots structured as 1 row by 2 columns

    - Create the first histogram for the males

    - Set the x-label

    - Set the y-label

    - Set the title of the plot

    - Create the second histogram for the females

    - Set the x-label

    - Set the y-label

    - Set the title of the plot

    - Arange the default layout for the figure

    - Display the figure
