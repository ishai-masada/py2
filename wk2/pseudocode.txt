While loop (a minimum of 6 times) and call each of these functions on each
string

    - Prompt the user for a string

        - If the string is empty: break the loop AND end the program

    - Print out the string as a display to the user

    - Use the corresponding functions for each step below

        - Print out a message if it is all alphabetic or not

            - Loop over the words of the sentence

                - Append all of the first letters of each word to a
                  separate list

                - If the concatenation of the list's letters is in the alphabet
                  string: the sentence is alphabetic

        - Print out a message if the string is all uppercase characters or not

          - Check if the string contains only capitalized letters

        - Print out a message if the string is alphanumeric or not

          - If the string is not completely made up of letters and if it is not
            completely made of of numbers: It is alphanumeric. The sentence is
            not completely either and should therefore contain both.

            - If either conditions are true: the sentence is not alphanumeric

        - Print the string after converting all of the lowercase characters to
          uppercase characters

            - Iterate over all of the characters in the string

                - If the character is a space or a quotation mark: go to the
                  next letter

                - If the character is lowercase: change it to uppercase

        - Print the string after converting all of the uppercase characters to
          lowercase characters

            - Iterate over all of the characters in the string

                - If the character is a space or a quotation mark: go to the
                  next letter

                - If the character is uppercase: change it to lowercase

        - Print the string after replacing all of the 's' with 'j'

            - Iterate over all of the characters in the string

                - If the character is an 's': change it to a 'j'

        - Print the string after replacing all of the 'j' with 's'

            - Iterate over all of the characters in the string

                - If the character is an 'j': change it to a 's'
