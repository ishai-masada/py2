- Import NumPy and random

- Create a list of positive and negative integers

- Create an array from that list of integers by passing the list to a
  user-defined function

    - Use the numpy array method given the list of values

- Prompt the user for an element to add to the array and change the type to
  an integer

- Append the new element to the array by passing both to a user-defined
  function

    - Use the numpy append method given the array and the new element

- Convert the type of the array back to an array of integers

- Replace all of the negative values in the array by passing it to a
  user-defined function

    - Use the numpy where method

        - The first argument is the condition that the elemenet is negative (The
          condition that each element may pass)

        - The second argument is 0 (What the element is replaced with if it
          passes the given condition)

        - The third aregument is the original element (What the element is
          replaced with if it doesn't pass the given condition)

- Define two arrays with a random number of integers

- Find the common elements between the two arrays by passing both to a
  user-defined function

    - Use the numpy intersect1d method given the two arrays as its arguments
