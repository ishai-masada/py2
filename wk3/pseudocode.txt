- Infinite Loop

    - Store the user's choice into a variable

    - Call the correct function that corresponds to the user's input

        - Call the add function if the user's input is "add":

            - Prompt the user to input the name of the item that they want to
              add to the grocery list

            - Prompt the user to input the item's cost

        - Call the delete function if the user's input is "add":

            - Prompt the user to input the name of the item that they want to
              delete from the grocery list

            - Remove the item from the grocery list using the name provided
              by the user

        - Call the print function if the user's input is "add":

            - Iterate over the grocery list

                - Print out the name and cost of each item

        - Call the go shopping function if the user's input is "add":

            - Iterate over the grocery list

                - Print out the name of each item

            - Calculate and print the total cost of the items on the list

        - Exit the program if the user's input is "add":

            - Exit the infinite loop
